    <!-- Abstract -->
    <meta name="description" content="This article engages with the modern history of the 'hammer model' of art and literature, which reconstructs the representational passage from reflection to action. This model is crucial for understanding the cynical portrayals of realistic action in contemporary art and literature. Marxist cultural theory generally understands these portrayals as indicative of a widespread acceptance of the governing logic of capital. This article argues that they also valorize 'strategic cultures' that help individuals thrive in capitalism. This approach is particularly evident in streaming television, where fictional professionals, activists, and scientists tackle challenges in life and politics using strategic tools and trades endorsed by capitalism. Not only do these portrayals promote strategies that enable groups and individuals to manage difficulties related to capitalism for personal profit, but they also limit the imagination of radical alternatives. This article contends that streaming television acts as a Trojan horse for the strategic cultures of capital, underscoring the necessity for a different hammer model of art and literature.">
